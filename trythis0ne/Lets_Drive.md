# trythis0ne Let's_Drive Solution

I downloaded the image and run `strings filename.bmp` in the command line.

i found in the end of the file this string:
```53773333742D3569787433336E2100```

which looks like hex string... let's convert it from hex: `Sw33t-5ixt33n!`

**Flag:** ***`Sw33t-5ixt33n!`***
