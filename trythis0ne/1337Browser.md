in this level we need to change the HTTP-header, to fake our web browser.
```
wget http://trythis0ne.com/levels/web-challanges/1337B/pwd.php --header="User-Agent: 1337Browser_V3.1"
```
i run this command in wsl, and then open the file pwd.php to see the output:
`GoodWork! the password is lizirulezzz :)`


**Flag:** ***`lizirulezzz`***
