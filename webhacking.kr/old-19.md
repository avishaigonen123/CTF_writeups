in the cookie *user id* you need to insert the next value:
```
MGNjMTc1YjljMGYxYjZhODMxYzM5OWUyNjk3NzI2NjE4Mjc3ZTA5MTBkNzUwMTk1YjQ0ODc5NzYxNmUwOTFhZDZmOGY1NzcxNTA5MGRhMjYzMjQ1Mzk4OGQ5YTE1MDFiODY1YzBjMGI0YWIwZTA2M2U1Y2FhMzM4N2MxYTg3NDE3YjhiOTY1YWQ0YmNhMGU0MWFiNTFkZTdiMzEzNjNhMQ==
```

you can find the code that generate this here: [old-19]
```py
{% include_relative scripts/old-19.py %}
```

Trying including with different names:
```py
{% include_relative scripts/old-20.py %}
```
```py
{% include_relative scripts/ouroboros.py %}
```

And with the regex?
So, let's write our script: [regexMaster.py]
```py
{% include_relative scripts/regexMaster.py %}
```


Changed... maybe now?
