in this challenge i read the code and searched for a function that check the passage, for crossing the river.

![example](./images/RPG1_1.png)

i override this function by running this command: `Game_Map.prototype.checkPassage = () => true;`

![example](./images/RPG1_2.png)

and then, i was able to cross the river!
