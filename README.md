# CTF Write-Ups ðŸ“š  
A collection of my capture-the-flag (CTF) challenge write-ups â€” solutions, insights and code from wargames Iâ€™ve solved.

## What this is  
This repository documents challenges Iâ€™ve completed from various platforms, with the goal of:  
- **Recording** what Iâ€™ve learned for myself.  
- **Sharing** the techniques and thought-process with anyone else interested in CTFs.  
Write-ups are kept concise: youâ€™ll find commands used, exploitation path, reasoning and flags.

## What youâ€™ll find  
- Write-ups with step-by-step solution walkthroughs.  
- Relevant code or scripts used (if applicable).  
- Insights into the approach, tools and analytic process.  
- Flags or results showing the completion of each challenge.

## My Write-Up Website  
I also maintain a **dedicated website** showcasing my write-ups â€” check it out here: [https://avishaigonen123.github.io/CTF_writeups/](https://avishaigonen123.github.io/CTF_writeups/)

## Why it matters  
- Solving CTFs is a strong way to build hands-on security skills (web, pwn, rev, crypto).  
- Writing up your solution helps solidify what you learned and reflect on your method.  
- Sharing these helps others learn by example, and shows your progression if you use this professionally.  

## How to connect or contribute  
If youâ€™d like to suggest a challenge, correct a write-up or add your own:  
- Fork the repository.  
- Add your content aligning with the style of existing write-ups.  
- Submit a Pull Request and Iâ€™ll review it.  
- Open an Issue if you spot an error or have feedback.
