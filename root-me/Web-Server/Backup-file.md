We know the challenge is about backup files, and usaally, there is backup files like filename + `~`.
So, let's try and get `index.php~` (if exist)

I tried, and got a file that i downloaded which is called `index.php_`, there i could saw the source code, plus these lines:
```php
$username="ch11";
$password="OCCY9AcNm1tj";
```

**Flag:** ***`OCCY9AcNm1tj`***
